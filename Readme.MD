# Project Overview

This project is the **API Gateway** for my **Expense Tracker** project. However, it can also be used as an example for other projects. I implemented it in a reactive manner, as reactive is much better suited for an API gateway. The individual microservices are still MVC servlet style, but they work fine with this setup.
